## ✨ What is Pyxis?

- **Pyxis is a high-mobility browser IDE designed for iPad that launches in just 1 second.**
- **Since Pyxis is a static site, there is no need to start a server, and as a result, no charges are incurred.**

### 🌍 **18 Languages Worldwide - Global Coding Experience**

**Pyxis speaks your language.**

> 日本語 • English • 中文 • 繁體中文 • 한국어 • Español • Français • Deutsch • Italiano • Português • Русский • Nederlands • Türkçe • العربية • हिन्दी • ไทย • Tiếng Việt • Bahasa Indonesia • Svenska • Polski

Break language barriers with a truly global IDE. Developers worldwide can use Pyxis comfortably in their native language.

### 🎯 Built For

<div align="center">

| 📱 **iPad Users** | 💻 **PC Owners** |
|:---:|:---:|
| Serious coding on iPad | Not serious enough for VS Code |
| Stackblitz is too heavy | Quick code edits |
| Touch-optimized IDE | Extended note-taking |
| Lightweight performance | Casual, instant access |

</div>

### 🚀 Why Not Stackblitz?

Stackblitz is a sophisticated IDE, but has these challenges:
- **Heavy on iPad** - High memory consumption
- **Web-focused** - Limited for other use cases
- **Small screen issues** - Not mobile-optimized
- **Touch UI problems** - Not optimized for iPad gestures

**Pyxis solves these problems:**
- ⚡ **1-second startup** - Serverless static hosting for instant launch
- � **iPad-optimized** - Touch gestures and dual editor support
- 🎨 **Versatile** - Not just web dev, but docs and notes too
- 🪶 **Lightweight** - Smooth even on iPad

> 💡 **Desktop-like experience with iPad mobility!**
> 🖥️ **Tauri Desktop supported!** Use Pyxis as a native app on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

---

### 🔄 **Local Git - Version Control in Browser**

**Local Git is nearly complete!** Branch, merge, commit, reset - all major Git features in your browser.
- 🎨 **Visual diffs** - Beautiful code change visualization
- 🌿 **Branch operations** - Experiment safely, revert anytime
- 💾 **Export with .git** - Download entire repository including .git folder
- 🛡️ **Safe learning** - Break anything without consequences! Perfect for Git beginners

> **GitHub Integration**: Remote repository connection is on hold pending GitHub application approval. Local Git is fully functional.

---

### 🧠 **AI Assistant Diff Adoption UI**
<div align="center">
  <img src="readme-assets/IMG_0035.png" alt="AI Assistant git diff adoption UI" width="80%" />
</div>
Pyxis features an AI assistant that helps you review and adopt code diffs. This provides a more intuitive Git operation and review experience.

---

### ⚡ **Node.js & TypeScript Runtime - Lightning Fast Execution**
<div align="center">
  <img src="readme-assets/IMG_1469.png" alt="Node.js Execution" width="80%" />
</div>

**Custom implementation without WASM**—incredibly fast, and supports not only Node.js but also TypeScript execution (via Babel Standalone and advanced normalization). The runtime allows you to use `fs`, `readline`, and even `userinterface` (for interactive console apps), just like in a real Node.js environment.
- ⚡ **Instant execution** - No compilation, zero wait time
- 📁 **File operations** - Full support for `fs`, `path`, `readline`, and `userinterface` modules
- 🌀 **TypeScript/Babel support** - TypeScript runs instantly via Babel Standalone and normalization system
- 🎯 **Casual coding** - Perfect for algorithm testing, learning, and interactive console apps

Emulates file operations and interactive user input/output that are impossible in plain JavaScript, providing a genuine Node.js/TypeScript learning environment.

> **Limitations**: No WASM means some features like native modules and child_process are unsupported. Sufficient for basic Node.js/TypeScript learning and simple scripts.

---

### � **Smart File Operations - Find Anything Instantly**
