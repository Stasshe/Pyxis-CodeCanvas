## ✨ What is Pyxis?

- **Pyxis is a high-mobility browser IDE designed for iPad that launches in just 1 second.**
- **Since Pyxis is a static site, there is no need to start a server, and as a result, no charges are incurred.**

### 🌍 **18 Languages Worldwide - Global Coding Experience**

**Pyxis speaks your language.**

> 日本語 • English • 中文 • 繁體中文 • 한국어 • Español • Français • Deutsch • Italiano • Português • Русский • Nederlands • Türkçe • العربية • हिन्दी • ไทย • Tiếng Việt • Bahasa Indonesia • Svenska • Polski

Break language barriers with a truly global IDE. Developers worldwide can use Pyxis comfortably in their native language.

### 🎯 Built For

<div align="center">

| 📱 **iPad Users** | 💻 **PC Owners** |
|:---:|:---:|
| Serious coding on iPad | Not serious enough for VS Code |
| Stackblitz is too heavy | Quick code edits |
| Touch-optimized IDE | Extended note-taking |
| Lightweight performance | Casual, instant access |

</div>

### 🚀 Why Not Stackblitz?

Stackblitz is a sophisticated IDE, but has these challenges:
- **Heavy on iPad** - High memory consumption
- **Web-focused** - Limited for other use cases
- **Small screen issues** - Not mobile-optimized
- **Touch UI problems** - Not optimized for iPad gestures

**Pyxis solves these problems:**
- ⚡ **1-second startup** - Serverless static hosting for instant launch
- � **iPad-optimized** - Touch gestures and dual editor support
- 🎨 **Versatile** - Not just web dev, but docs and notes too
- 🪶 **Lightweight** - Smooth even on iPad

> 💡 **Desktop-like experience with iPad mobility!**
> 🖥️ **Tauri Desktop supported!** Use Pyxis as a native app on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

---

### 🔥 **Live Reload (Instant Update) - Quick Site Building**
<div align="center">
  <img src="readme-assets/IMG_0034.png" alt="Live Reload in Action" width="80%" />
</div>

**HTML/CSS/JS only** - Perfect for quick browser testing without tedious setup.
- Instant updates on file save (Live Reload)
- Ideal for simple web development
- No setup required, just start coding

 > **Note**: Currently supports HTML/CSS/JS only. No WebContainer needed—Pyxis implements its own fast instant reload system.

---

### 🔄 **Local Git - Version Control in Browser**

**Local Git is nearly complete!** Branch, merge, commit, reset - all major Git features in your browser.
- 🎨 **Visual diffs** - Beautiful code change visualization
- 🌿 **Branch operations** - Experiment safely, revert anytime
- 💾 **Export with .git** - Download entire repository including .git folder
- 🛡️ **Safe learning** - Break anything without consequences! Perfect for Git beginners

> **GitHub Integration**: Remote repository connection is on hold pending GitHub application approval. Local Git is fully functional.

---

### 🧠 **AI Assistant Diff Adoption UI**
<div align="center">
  <img src="readme-assets/IMG_0035.png" alt="AI Assistant git diff adoption UI" width="80%" />
</div>
Pyxis features an AI assistant that helps you review and adopt code diffs. This provides a more intuitive Git operation and review experience.

---

### ⚡ **Node.js & TypeScript Runtime - Lightning Fast Execution**
<div align="center">
  <img src="readme-assets/IMG_1469.png" alt="Node.js Execution" width="80%" />
</div>

**Custom implementation without WASM**—incredibly fast, and supports not only Node.js but also TypeScript execution (via Babel Standalone and advanced normalization). The runtime allows you to use `fs`, `readline`, and even `userinterface` (for interactive console apps), just like in a real Node.js environment.
- ⚡ **Instant execution** - No compilation, zero wait time
- 📁 **File operations** - Full support for `fs`, `path`, `readline`, and `userinterface` modules
- 🌀 **TypeScript/Babel support** - TypeScript runs instantly via Babel Standalone and normalization system
- 🎯 **Casual coding** - Perfect for algorithm testing, learning, and interactive console apps

Emulates file operations and interactive user input/output that are impossible in plain JavaScript, providing a genuine Node.js/TypeScript learning environment.


> **Limitations**: No WASM means some features like native modules and child_process are unsupported. Sufficient for basic Node.js/TypeScript learning and simple scripts.

---

### 🐚 **Advanced Shell System - Full POSIX Shell Support**
<div align="center">
  <img src="readme-assets/IMG_0126.png" alt="Advanced Shell System" width="80%" />
</div>

**Achieve a full POSIX-compliant shell script execution environment in the browser!** Pyxis's unique StreamShell architecture supports most features of real Unix shells, including pipelines, redirections, control structures, variable expansion, and command substitution.

#### 🚀 Key Features
- **Pipeline Processing** - `cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3` for stream connections
- **Redirections** - `cmd > file`, `cmd >> file`, `cmd < file`, `cmd 2>&1`, etc. fully supported
- **Control Structures** - `if/then/else`, `for/while` loops, `break/continue`
- **Variable Expansion** - `$VAR`, `$(command)` command substitution, `((arithmetic))` arithmetic expansion
- **Logical Operators** - `&&`, `||` for conditional execution
- **Background Execution** - `cmd &` for asynchronous processing
- **File Operations** - `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `head`, `tail`, and other Unix commands
- **Script Execution** - Direct execution of `.sh` files

#### ⚡ Technical Features
- **Streaming Architecture** - True streaming processing using Node.js Stream API
- **Backpressure Support** - Memory-efficient data flow control
- **Process Abstraction** - Virtual process management in browser environment
- **fd Management** - Complete file descriptor emulation
- **Timeout Protection** - Automatic timeout to prevent infinite loops

**Shell Script Examples:**
```bash
# Pipeline processing
cat large-file.txt | grep "error" | head -10

# Redirections
ls -la > directory-listing.txt 2>&1

# Control structures
if [ -f "config.txt" ]; then
    echo "Config file exists"
    cat config.txt
else
    echo "Creating default config"
    echo "default=true" > config.txt
fi

# Arithmetic expansion
COUNT=$((COUNT + 1))
echo "Current count: $COUNT"
```

**Real shell experience in the browser!** Complex scripts and data processing all run smoothly in Pyxis's terminal.

> **StreamShell architecture ensures high memory efficiency for comfortable large data processing.**

> Note: Some system commands, bugs, and features are not yet fully supported. Further enhancements are planned for future updates. Please submit requests via issues.

[See Shell System Documentation](/docs/SHELL-SYSTEM.md) for details.

</div>

<div align="center">
  <img src="readme-assets/IMG_0117.png" alt="Template CLI Screenshot" width="80%" />
</div>

One of Pyxis's biggest features is its "Extension System." You can add VSCode-like UI extensions, use any npm library, create custom terminal commands, language packs, transpilers, and service extensions—all in TypeScript/TSX.

#### Highlights
- **CLI Template Generation**: Instantly scaffold new extensions with `pnpm run create-extension`. Even beginners can start developing extensions right away.
- **Full npm Library Support**: Use any external library you want.
- **Terminal Command Extensions**: Add custom commands via API and run them from Pyxis's terminal UI.
- **VSCode-like UI Extensions**: Add custom tabs and sidebar panels via API. Build intuitive UIs with React/TSX.
- **Language Packs & Service Extensions**: Add language packs or custom services as extensions.
- **Safe Sandbox Architecture**: Each extension runs independently and safely. IndexedDB is used for persistence and caching.

Pyxis extensions offer flexibility and power unmatched by any other browser IDE: VSCode-level UI extensions on Web/iPad, extensible terminal commands, and instant development with official templates.

See `/extensions/README.md` and `/Development/EXTENSION-TAB-SIDEBAR-API.md` for details.
